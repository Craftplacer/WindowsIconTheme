# Windows Icon Theme
An "accurate" icon theme for GNU/Linux themed around Windows.

## IconConv
Is a custom tool for mapping Windows `.ico` files and converting them to their icon theme counterpart.
It's configurable by config files.

[Project page](https://github.com/Craftplacer/WindowsIconTheme/projects/1)

### Note about the icon directory
The tool assumes the files in it were exported using [ResourcesExtract](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/resources_extract.html) (in other words formatted like `FILE_RESOURCE.ico`).

## Configurations
- [Windows 2000]()

## Contributing
I am happy about every pull request or issue made with improvements to the configurations and so on. If you have any questions, ask me (or open an issue if necessary).

## Copyright
I don't own any of the icons. (Microsoft and the respective application developers do)

If there's any violation, they have the right of taking releases or the icons inside this repository down. 

I'd appreciate contacting me first before anything.
